    "Dask Array provides a parallel, larger-than-memory, n-dimensional array using blocked algorithms. Simply put: distributed Numpy.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  **Parallel**: Uses all of the cores on your computer\n",
    "*  **Larger-than-memory**:  Lets you work on datasets that are larger than your available memory by breaking up your array into many small pieces, operating on those pieces in an order that minimizes the memory footprint of your computation, and effectively streaming data from disk.\n",
    "*  **Blocked Algorithms**:  Perform large computations by performing many smaller computations\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates one of Xarray's most powerful features: the ability to wrap dask arrays and allow users to seamlessly execute analysis code in parallel.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Learn the distinction between *eager* and *lazy* execution, and how Xarray can work either way\n",
    "- Understand key features of dask arrays\n",
    "- Work with Dask Arrays in much the same way you would work with a NumPy array\n",
    "- Learn that xarray DataArrays and Datasets are \"dask collections\" i.e. you can execute top-level dask functions such as dask.visualize(xarray_object)\n",
    "- Learn that all xarray built-in operations can transparently use dask\n",

Once the data were loaded into Xarray, we could interact with the `xarray.Datasets` and `xarray.DataArrays` as we would if we were working with `dask.arrays`. This can be a powerful tool for working with larger-than-memory datasets!\n",

    "### Dask Shortcomings\n",
    "\n",
    "Dask Array does not implement the entire Numpy interface.  Users expecting this\n",
    "will be disappointed.  Notably Dask Array has the following failings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Dask Array does not support some operations where the resulting shape\n",
    "    depends on the values of the array. For those that it does support\n",
    "    (for example, masking one Dask Array with another boolean mask),\n",
    "    the chunk sizes will be unknown, which may cause issues with other\n",
    "    operations that need to know the chunk sizes.\n",
    "2.  Dask Array does not attempt operations like ``sort`` which are notoriously\n",
    "    difficult to do in parallel and are of somewhat diminished value on very\n",
    "    large data (you rarely actually need a full sort).\n",
    "    Often we include parallel-friendly alternatives like [``topk``](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.topk.html).\n",
    "3.  Dask development is driven by immediate need, and so many lesser used\n",
    "    functions, like ``np.sometrue`` have simply not been implemented yet.  These would make excellent community contributions.\n",
