    "In the homework assignment you are asked to compute various terms in the global-average energy budget from the CESM control simulation and compare them to the observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the lecture notes, we walked through how to open the dataset and compute the time- and global averages.\n",

    "The main challenge here is just understanding how to relate the diagnostic fields in the CESM output dataset to the quantities you are asked to calculate. I give some additional guidance here."

    "## What do we mean by \"upwelling\", \"downwelling\", \"net\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand these terms, just picture the beam of radiation traveling between the surface of the Earth and the top of that atmosphere. “Downwelling” means traveling downward (i.e. toward the surface), and “upwelling” means traveling upward.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beam of shortwave (solar) radiation arrives from the sun at the top of the atmosphere and travels downward. Some of that beam is reflected back upward. So the quantity we have denoted as Q in our notes, the total sunlight incident upon the Earth, is the downwelling shorwave flux at the top of the atmosphere. The upwelling shortwave flux at the top of the atmosphere is a number that is smaller than Q and represents the reflection.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the longwave beam, it’s the same idea — there is a beam moving upward, or “upwelling”, and a beam moving downward, or “downwelling”. The difference is that this beam is generated by the Earth and the atmosphere itself.\n",
    "The upwelling flux at the surface is the surface emission. The downwelling flux at the surface is the radiation absorbed by the surface (originating somewhere in the atmosphere).\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"net\" flux is the difference between the upwelling and downwelling beams. We have to be careful about sign conventions! In the CESM data, \"net\" means net upward for longwave radiation, but net downward for shortwave radiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The net longwave flux at the top of the atmosphere is what we have called the Outgoing Longwave Radiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The net shortwave flux at the top of the atmosphere is what we have called the Absorbed Shortwave Radiation."

    "- All variables whose names being with `'F'` are an **energy flux** of some kind. \n",
    "- Most have a four-letter code, e.g. `'FLNT'`\n",
    "- `'FL'` means **longwave flux** (i.e. terrestrial)\n",
    "- `'FS'` means **shortwave flux** (i.e. solar)\n",

    "    - `'U'` = up\n",
    "    - `'D'` = down\n",
    "    - `'N'` = net\n",
    "- The fourth letter indicates the **location** of the flux:\n",
    "    - `'T'` = top of atmosphere\n",
    "    - `'S'` = surface\n",
    "- So `'FLNT'` means 'net longwave flux at the top of atmosphere', i.e. the outgoing longwave radiation or OLR.\n",
