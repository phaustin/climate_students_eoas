    "- This critical lapse rate is the tunable parameter in our combined **Radiative-Convective Model** or RCM.\n",
    "- Using a value of 6.5 K / km and realistic gas profiles gives a reasonable (not perfect) fit to the observed air temperatures.\n",
    "- The **RCM represents the \"tug-of-war\"** between **radiation** (trying to warm the surface and cool the troposphere) and **convection** (cool the surface and warm the troposphere).\n",
