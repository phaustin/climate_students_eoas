    "Look at the y-axis in our first plot of zonal mean zonal wind. Notice that the variable is not 'pressure', it's 'hybrid level at midpoints'. If you explore the dimension 'lev' in atmfile you find the units are 'level' and the standard name is: 'atmosphere_hybrid_sigma_pressure_coordinate'.  The CESM model default outputs are on model levels, which are not isobaric surfaces. This version of the CESM uses what's known as a hybrid vertical co-ordinate: near the surface, the levels follow the terrain, often known as a 'sigma' co-ordinate; this makes calculation of the dynamics near the surface simpler. At the top of the model, the levels are isobaric surfaces; in between they are a hybrid, or \"sigma-pressure'. This is illustrated in the schematic below.\n",

    "For more accurate plotting we need to convert the data from these model co-ordinates onto pressure levels, by using the identity p(t,k,j,i) = a(k)*p0 + b(k)*ps(t,j,i), where a and b are parameters (functions of level only). Handily NCAR (the developers of the CESM model) have built functions to do this for us, originally in NCL (the NCAR Command Language) and now in python (https://www.pyngl.ucar.edu/Functions/Ngl.vinth2p.shtml).\n",
    "\n",
    "This can take quite some time to run, particularly if you want to convert monthly or daily data onto pressure levels. Ideally this should be written as a separate function and run outside of your notebooks, but we will do this once here as an example."
