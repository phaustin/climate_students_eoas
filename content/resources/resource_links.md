## Working with model datasets

### CMIP6
- [Lamont course on earth data](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/lectures/models/intro_models.html)  -- 4 notebooks on CMIP6 model analysis

- [CMIP6 scenarios](https://climate-scenarios.canada.ca/?page=cmip6-overview-notes) -- model forcing scenarios (shared socio-economic pathways)

- [IPCC working group 1 sixth assessment report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/)

- [Processed time series and maps](https://climate-scenarios.canada.ca/?page=cmip6-scenarios)

- [google sheet with CMIP6 variables](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UUtoz6Ofyjlpx5LdqhKcwHFz2SGoTQV2_yekHyMfL9Y/edit#gid=1221485271)

- [Project Pythia CMIP6 cookbook](https://projectpythia.org/cmip6-cookbook/README.html) -- workflow examples for climate senstivity, mean surface temperature, precipitation, regridding, multimodel means

- [Using the Pangeo catalog](https://pangeo-data.github.io/pangeo-cmip6-cloud/accessing_data.html) -- how to search and load datasets - includes CMIP6 and LENS (large ensembles), has a variety of MIP experiments, including the standard 'scenario' experiments, but also 1%CO2 increase experiments, land-use experiments (including deforestation), polar-amplification experiments....

- [CMIP6 variable list](https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/mips/cmip3/variableList.html#overview) -- all the model variables in the CMIP6 table

- [Other CMIP6 data access](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/search/cmip6/) -- where to download data from model experiments that aren't included in the Pangeo catalog, including other MIPS

- [Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) included in CMIP6](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/modelling-wgcm-mip-catalogue/modelling-wgcm-cmip6-endorsed-mips) -- details on difference simulations run by multiple climate modelling centres across the World to address apecific questions about the climate

- [CESM2-LENS](https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/community-projects/lens2) Details of the CESM2 Large ENsemble Simulations (LENS) that can be used to address questions of natural variability. 

- [CESM1-LENS data and example jupyter notebooks](https://ncar.github.io/cesm-lens-aws/) -- some examples of jupyter notebooks analysing large ensemble data

- [Climate Data Gateway at NCAR](https://www.earthsystemgrid.org/) -- Additional access to CESM simulations, including the CESM2-LENS

- [Introduction to Taylor diagrams](https://cdat.llnl.gov/Jupyter-notebooks/vcs/Taylor_Diagrams/Taylor_Diagrams.html) -- a tool for comparing models against each other and against data
